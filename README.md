<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This is my master thesis project. Why you may want to look at the Project? Well if you are interested in electric motors, model base design and coding you are in the right place.

This folden is organizzed in three parts:
* C Code: which include the firmware and all the algorithms used for controlling the motor
* Thesis: contains the thesis link
* Model base project: Contains the model base part, so the control algorithm design and the system model
